# Compatibility Matrix

This provider targets specific KKP minor versions. Patch releases within a minor line should be compatible unless noted.

- Provider v0.1.x → KKP CE 2.28.x (tested 2.28.2)

Notes:
- Other KKP versions may work, but are not validated.
- When adopting new KKP minor versions, a new provider minor release will typically declare support (e.g., v0.2.x → KKP 2.29.x).
- Breaking changes will be called out explicitly in release notes.
